## Challenges & Contributions

- On 9-10-20, Jada Arnett mentioned using shoelace.io for each table grid building.

- On 9-11-20, TA - Christina Starr helped me troubleshoot connecting my var hour and var planEntryInput to my HTML through using (this)statements along with targeting the sibling or children page elements. Doing this would help me be able to take in user inputs and appropriately store them in local storage.
